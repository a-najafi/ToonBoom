# **ToonBoom**  

ToonBoom is a grid-based puzzle game featuring **strategic level progression**, **power-up mechanics**, and **event-driven visualization**. The architecture is designed for **clean separation of data and logic**, ensuring scalability and maintainability.  

## **🎮 Application Flow**  
- The game launches in the **MainMenu** scene.  
- **PlayerState** manages progression data, tracking completed levels.  
- Players can replay completed levels and attempt the next available one.  
- Completing a level unlocks the next one.  
- Upon clicking the **Play** button, the selected level loads.  
- The game ends in a **win screen** (if objectives are met) or a **lose screen** (if turns run out).  
- Both screens return to the **MainMenu** when clicked.

## **🎮 Player & Level Design**  

### **📈 Player Design**  
- Level progression is stored in **`Resources/PlayerDesign`** as a **list of references** to `LevelDesign` scriptable objects.  
- **PlayerSystem** loads the `PlayerDesign` asset and manages all progression logic.  

### **📈 Level Design**  
Each level consists of **three key design elements**:  
1️⃣ **Grid Config:** Defines the grid bounds and initial entities before random entities fill the grid.  
2️⃣ **Objectives:** Specifies level completion requirements.  
3️⃣ **Entity Spawn Design:** Determines **grid refill rules** and conditions for spawning entities.

## **⚙️ Core Game Systems**  

### **🔹 Block & Powerup Configuration**  
- **`BlockTapSystemConfiguration`** defines how block combos translate into power-ups.  
- **`PowerupTapSystemConfiguration`** configures how power-up combos evolve into stronger power-ups.  

### **🔹 Architecture Principles**  
✅ **Separation of Data & Logic** – Data is stored as **States** (single-instance structures) and **Entities** (defined via interfaces and classes).  
✅ **Strict Data Access Control** – Systems manipulate data only within their scope based on entity interfaces.  
✅ **Serialization Enhancements** – Extended serialization simplifies configuration.  
✅ **Minimal Unity Dependencies** – Core logic is mostly independent of Unity and can later be transitioned to .NET.  

### **🔹 Event Sequencing & Visualization**  
- **Visualization is event-driven**, using a **custom Event Sequencer**.  
- Events contain an **async function** that handles UI interactions.  
- Future improvements will allow event implementations to be completely decoupled from the sequencer, similar to how systems manage state separately from logic.

## **🛠 ToonBoom Editor Tools**  

### **📈 Level Editor**  
The **Level Editor** streamlines level creation and entity placement:  

#### **GridConfigEditor**  
- Acts as a **reference grid** in the editor.  
- Allows easy configuration of starting entities.  
- Includes two right-click inspector actions:  
  - 📝 **`SaveGridConfig`** – Saves the current editor setup to the assigned `GridConfig` scriptable object.  
  - 📂 **`LoadGridConfig`** – Loads the `GridConfig` from disk into the editor scene.  

#### **GridNodeEntityEditor**  
- Manages **entity placement** on the grid.  
- Automatically snaps entities to valid grid locations.  
- Updates entity visuals when properties change.  

### **📈 ToonBoom Editor Module**  
- Contains **editor-only** scripts for custom workflows.  
- Enhances productivity by enabling seamless in-editor visualization and configuration.

## **🛠 Core Game Logic Modules**  

### **📈 System Architecture**  
All core logic is modular and grouped into **Systems**, each handling a **single responsibility**.  

#### **Most Important Systems:**  
- 🎯 **`TapSystem`** – Handles player input and processes tap interactions.  
- 🏁 **`StartGame`** – Initializes level state based on level design.  
- ⚡ **`EventSystem`** – Manages queued events for visualization via `EventSequencer`.  

---

## **📈 Core Game Managers**  

### **ToonBoomGameManager**  
- **Primary MonoBehaviour** that initializes and manages game logic based on the player's current level.  

### **EntityVisualizerManager**  
- Handles **object pooling** for visualizers representing grid entities.  

---

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**  
✅ **Complete separation of visualization from event logic** for cleaner UI handling.  
✅ **Extend system call order configuration** to allow **dynamic scripting of system execution.**  
✅ **Refine serialization system** for even easier content creation.
